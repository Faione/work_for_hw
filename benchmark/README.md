# eBPF overhead benchmark

This is a simple eBPF benchmark showing overhead of eBPF probes.

## Setup

We're using `getpid()` as a simple syscall to provide a reference. To measure
the overhead of eBPF probes we measure performance in the following cases:

* No probes attached
* Empty probe doing nothing at all
* Simple probe incrementing hash map with pid as a key
* Complex probe incrementing hash map with a complex key:
  * PID
  * Random number obtained as `time_in_ns % 1024`
  * Command name up to 32 chars

You can see exact code of probes in [`probes` directory](probes).

## Results

The results below are from MacBook Air (M1, 2020) running Linux 6.5-rc1
in QEMU. We see the following results:

| kprobe complex     |   346 |            229 |             196% |

Big slowdown in terms of % for complex case may sounds like terrible,
but you have to remember that we're using a fast `getpid()` syscall.

The main number to look at above is overhead in nanoseconds, because that's
what you're going to pay no matter how fast or frequent function you're
probing is. 200-300ns overhead for the complex case of `getpid` is a lot, but
for tracing operations like disk access it's nothing compared to baseline.

Notice how tracepoints are faster than fentry and fentry is faster than kprobe.

Keep in mind that these numbers are for a single logical CPU core.

Your mileage may vary depending on your hardware, make sure to test
if you are hyper sensitive to any slowdowns.

## Estimating cost of existing function calls

You can use `funclatency` from [bcc-tools](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc)
to estimate cost of function calls in the kernel to get a baseline.

Example for `getpid` syscall:

```
$ sudo /usr/share/bcc/tools/funclatency sys_getpid
Tracing 1 functions for "sys_getpid"... Hit Ctrl-C to end.

         2 -> 3          : 0        |                                        |
         4 -> 7          : 0        |                                        |
         8 -> 15         : 0        |                                        |
        16 -> 31         : 0        |                                        |
        32 -> 63         : 0        |                                        |
        64 -> 127        : 0        |                                        |
       128 -> 255        : 52       |**                                      |

      1024 -> 2047       : 48       |**                                      |
      2048 -> 4095       : 46       |**                                      |
      4096 -> 8191       : 0        |                                        |
      8192 -> 16383      : 1        |                                        |
```

These measurements already include some overhead from `funclatency` itself.

You can see frequency of calls in the output as well.
